# how to work this thing
the hardest part is you can only make 50 extensions per account, so you need like 100 accounts to eat all the extensions. i used tmail.link burners but they caught on and banned tmail.link. anyways if you have like 100 proton email addresses, you can have as many congress phone numbers as you want. i hope someone else decides to use my wonderful script

i did this because i am a gay loser and i hate fun and i hate volunteer efforts and i want people to be sad and miserable basically. wait no actually i just thought it would be funny. and i figured free palestine would piss off the zionist deutschlanders which seem to be so common at CCC.........
